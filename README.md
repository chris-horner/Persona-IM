A reimplementation of the instant messaging app seen in Persona 5 for Android using Compose UI.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is _not_ a functioning messaging app. It simulates a single conversation to demonstrate how such an app would be implemented in Compose UI.

Persona 5 has one of the most stylish user interfaces, including its in-game messaging app! This repository attempts to answer what it might look like if it were a real app, and how it could be built for Android.
